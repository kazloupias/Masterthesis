# Masterthesis
The bash script, dataset and modules needed to run for the analysis of my master thesis. Code adopted and modified from the Sockey 2 Multilingual Translation tutorial (Hieber, Domhan, and Denkowski, 2020)

In order to run the experiment, run the finalscriptthesis.sh bash script, which will set up the virtual environment and install the necessary packages, dependencies and drivers for this script to function. This script is written for a virtual machine built on Ubuntu 18.04, and assumes a CUDA capable NVIDIA GPU is available to use for training and translating.
